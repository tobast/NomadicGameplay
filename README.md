NomadicGameplay - A nomadic way to play Minecraft!
==========

NomadicGameplay is a Bukkit plugin enabling you to play Minecraft in a new way - like nomads!
...Well, in fact, this "game mode" is already well-known. But not yet managed through a plugin, allowing you to bend the game's rules around this gameplay!

Context
----

Hey, traveller. Do you remember the last nice time you had? Well, it was surely before the Invasion. Now, no place is safe anymore. After the Invasion, They came all, from Their pits, spreading fear, death and... That smell... The smell of rotten, burnt flesh.
Until now, you'll have to survive. But in this invaded world, surviving implies moving. Moving forever, always, far away. A nomadic life. I hope you'll be as lucky as me, traveller. So far, I managed to survive. Unlike many of them. Wait. What was that noise...? Get up! 'Suppose we'd better start moving!

Features
----

* Plant your camp where you want with a command
* Your new camp shall always be at least n blocks away from the old one
  (configurable).
* You're in hostile environment! Keep moving. An "invasion" will be triggered after a certain time, according to a gaussian distribution around configured values.
* If one of you is not playing for some time, he/she'll be teleported right to the new camp.
* If one of you dies, he'll not be able to join again the server for a predefined time.
* ...except if his/her mates accomplished a kind of shamanic rite to save his
  soul from the jaws of death!
